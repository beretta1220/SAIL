# STEMnauts Atmosphere Independent Lander (SAIL)

UND ARC SAIL Payload Module

## NASA Objective

SAIL is an in-air deployable payload capable of safely retaining and recovering a group of 4 STEMnauts in a unique predetermined orientation without the use of a parachute or streamer or chemical energetics below 500 ft AGL. The landing shall occur under acceptable descent and landing parameters for the safe recovery of human beings.

## Description

The Advanced Rocketry Club of the University of North Dakota is designing a UAS-style payload that will deploy upon descent, autonomously land under acceptable parameters, and log flight data. The final electronics package shall be a custom 2x2 in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that will be mounted on the SAIL payload with various connections to the battery, safety switch, landing leg release, and Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs).
